    "## üìå Introduction\n",
    "In this project, we implement a **Wordle-style game** using astronomy terms.  \n",
    "Players guess 5-letter astronomy words with feedback given in color-coded form (green, yellow, gray).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "- Demonstrate Python skills from **Weeks 1‚Äì4** (OOP, data structures, file I/O, NumPy, Matplotlib).\n",
    "- Show how fundamental programming tools can build a useful educational game.\n",
    "- Track player statistics across multiple games.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéÆ How to Play\n",
    "- You have **6 attempts** to guess the secret word.\n",
    "- Feedback after each guess:\n",
    "  - üü© = correct letter in the correct spot  \n",
    "  - üü® = letter is in the word but wrong spot  \n",
    "  - ‚¨ú = letter not in the word  \n",
    "- After 3 failed guesses, you‚Äôll receive a **subtle astronomy hint from Claude AI**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Features\n",
    "- Difficulty levels: **Easy / Medium / Hard**  \n",
    "- Color-coded feedback like Wordle  \n",
    "- Claude AI integration for hints  \n",
    "- External `.txt` files for word lists (easy to expand or customize)\n",

    "## Word Loading Functions  \n",
    "\n",
    "We define two helper functions:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- One function loads the **astronomy word list** based on the chosen difficulty (easy, medium, hard). It builds the correct filename, opens the file, removes empty lines, formats everything in uppercase, and returns the words as a **list**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The other function loads a **general dictionary of valid guesses** from a separate file. It keeps only five-letter alphabetic words, converts them to uppercase for consistency, and stores them in a **set**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why list vs. set?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Astronomy word list (list):** We use a **list** because later in the game we need to randomly choose a secret word. Lists keep the order of items and work well with functions like `random.choice()`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Valid guesses (set):** We use a **set** because during gameplay we only need to check if a guessed word is valid or not. Sets are optimized for super-fast lookups (`O(1)` on average), so checking membership (`if guess in valid_words`) is much faster than searching through a list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üí° **Example:** If the player types in `\"EARTH\"`, the program checks instantly whether `\"EARTH\"` exists inside the set of valid words. Using a set makes this almost instantaneous compared to scanning through thousands of words in a list.  \n"
